16 roadmap

chiptune.c:
    add more player(s) for sfx.

run.c:
    tile translation
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (set z=0 to hide) when transitioning to run mode
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
    
    sprites:
        add velocity to objects

sprite pattern commands:  no loops are possible, march through commands

    end/wait (end if argument is 0, wait quadratically)
        wait = argument + argument*argument/4 (or something like that)

    if not move goto
    if not run goto
    if not air goto
    if not fire goto

    set state
        standard states (8 options):
            stop, turn (90, 180, 270), move, run, jump, air, fire,
        edge behaviors (8 options) 
            stop, turn, fall, jump, stop if slow enough or fall, stop if slow enough or jump, etc.
    
    randomize next command, argument gives steps:
        arg possible values
        0   0-15
        1   1, 15
        2   1, 8, 15
        3   0, 1, 8, 15
        4   0-7
        5   4-11
        6   8-15
        7   0-3, 12-15
        8   0-3
        9   4-7
        10  8-11
        11  12-15
        12  0,4,8,12
        13  1,5,9,13
        14  2,6,10,14
        15  3,7,11,15
            
    set speed 
        if < 8
            for directional input
        if >= 8
            set jump speed
    set acceleration/deceleration
    
    look for closest player, change direction based on argument

    handle player directional input (1 bit player for player 1, 2=left/right, 4=up/down, 8=mirrored), using current speed (as set by the "set speed" command)
    handle player special input (1 bit for player 1, 2=jump, 4=run, 8=fire)
    spawn other sprite (projectile) directly in front of player,
        set velocity using next 8 bits??
        
    spawn tile directly in front of player (at nearest grid point)

    set shake screen
        2 bits intensity, 2 bits duration
    make noise
        4 bits for instrument, then play random note in the instrument octave
    

unlock pattern commands:
    wait
    set spawn location x, y (needs 14 bits total for both x,y)
    spawn sprite
    spawn tile (this can also destroy a tile if you spawn an "air" tile)
    randomize command
    set spawn location to player location (2 bits for offset in each direction)
    set spawn location delta x, y
    shake screen
    make noise

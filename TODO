16 roadmap


map:
    copy tiles when changing map dimensions

game.c
    game edit menu, also set to play
    goes before map edit in SELECT route.  
    press START to play
        warn if map is not saved

run.c:
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (set z=0 to hide) when transitioning to run mode
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
        BUG HERE, not sure why not everything is hiding
    
    trigger edge behavior when hitting the edge of the map

    sprite attacks on tiles, too.
    
    do we want to allow for connected sprites?  (e.g. swinging a sword sprite, attached to player or enemy, or power-up makes you twice as tall, etc.)

sprite pattern commands:  no loops are possible, march through commands

    look for closest player, change direction based on argument


allow for 8 unlock commands, 
    4 tied to tiles, 
    one for startup / level initialization, 
    one for game loop, (constantly running)
    one for win,
    one for dead,

unlock pattern commands:
    wait
    set damage multiplier -- start every sprite with 15 health, you can have single or double damage hits, but if the damage multiplier is f, even a single hit is fatal.
    heal player
    set letter box -- add black lines above/below the play field
    set letter box delta
    set spawn location x, y (needs 14 bits total for both x,y)
    spawn sprite
    spawn tile (this can also destroy a tile if you spawn an "air" tile)
    randomize command
    set spawn location to player location (2 bits for offset in each direction)
    set spawn location delta x, y
    shake screen
    make noise
    set game-type (platformer, top-down adventure) via GRAVITY
        determine platformer or not by GRAVITY only.  don't have separate variable.

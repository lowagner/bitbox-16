16 roadmap

game.c
    game edit menu, also set to play
    goes before map edit in SELECT route.  
    press START to play
        warn if map is not saved

map.c:
    force save before allowing to PLAY with 0, A
    maybe take out SAVE with 0, X

chiptune.c:
    add more player(s) for sfx.

run.c:
    tile translation
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (set z=0 to hide) when transitioning to run mode
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
    
    sprites:
        run sprite commands

sprite pattern commands:  no loops are possible, march through commands

    end/wait (end if argument is 0, wait quadratically)
        wait = argument + argument*argument/4 (or something like that)
    
    look for closest player, change direction based on argument

    handle player special input (1 bit for player 1, 2=jump, 4=run, 8=fire)
    spawn other sprite (projectile) directly in front of player,
        set velocity using next 8 bits??
        
    spawn tile directly in front of player (at nearest grid point)

    set shake screen
        2 bits intensity, 2 bits duration
    make noise
        4 bits for instrument, then play random note in the instrument octave
    

unlock pattern commands:
    wait
    set spawn location x, y (needs 14 bits total for both x,y)
    spawn sprite
    spawn tile (this can also destroy a tile if you spawn an "air" tile)
    randomize command
    set spawn location to player location (2 bits for offset in each direction)
    set spawn location delta x, y
    shake screen
    make noise

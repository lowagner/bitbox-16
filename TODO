16 roadmap


map:
    copy tiles when changing map dimensions

game.c
    game edit menu, also set to play
    goes before map edit in SELECT route.  
    press START to play
        warn if map is not saved

run.c:
    tile translation
    hide sprites which are completely set inside another block with zero velocity.
        - compute a "hidden" property (set z=0 to hide) when transitioning to run mode
        - reset when going to map mode (always z=1 or higher)
        BUG HERE, not sure why not everything is hiding
    
    sprites:
        run sprite commands
            * look
        collisions, damage tacking

    sprite attacks on tiles, too.
    
    do we want to allow for connected sprites?  (e.g. swinging a sword sprite, attached to player or enemy, or power-up makes you twice as tall, etc.)

sprite pattern commands:  no loops are possible, march through commands

    look for closest player, change direction based on argument


allow for more than 4 unlock commands, 
    4 tied to tiles, 
    one for startup / level initialization, 
    one for game loop, (constantly running)
    one for win,
    one for dead,

unlock pattern commands:
    wait
    set letter box -- add black lines above/below the play field
    set letter box delta
    set spawn location x, y (needs 14 bits total for both x,y)
    spawn sprite
    spawn tile (this can also destroy a tile if you spawn an "air" tile)
    randomize command
    set spawn location to player location (2 bits for offset in each direction)
    set spawn location delta x, y
    shake screen
    make noise
    set game-type (platformer, top-down adventure, shmup)
        for platformers, set strength of gravity 

sprite drawing:
    try blitting to a u4 buffer, then drawing to draw_buffer as u32,
    using u32 words (u16 color * 2, 256 indexes in super_palette)
